# Trust
> What builds and breaks trust

## Builds Trust:
* Mine
  * Communication
  * Responsability
  * Consistency
* Others
  * On time, develops over time
  * Follow up / follow through
  * Personal understanding - background
  * Adding value
  * Open, 2 way street of feedback
  * Confidentiality
  * Make conversation about them
  * No judgement
  * Honest about limitations
  * Vulnerable about difficulties
  * Relatability - similar interests, likes
  * About them not you


## Breaks Trust:
* Opposite of previous slide
* Flake in meetings
* Hiding failure
* Being “above them” - not relating to struggles
* Seeing them as “broken” vs “having an issue”

## How to Build Trust
* `Active Listening` — When listening **“recreate”** what their partner said to affirm their experience and ensure that you understand them correctly.
* `Show Vulnerability` — Share related challenges and experiences you’ve had to empathize with and validate their experience.
* `Ask for Permission Before Giving Advice` — This maintains their agency and opens them up to your advice.
* `Manage Expectations` — Surprises make people feel unsafe. Make sure people know what you think is coming up, whether good or bad.

> You gotta make expectations that you can achieve. That will give you happiness, to meet or slightly exceed the expectation. If the goal is far from reach, set an expecation that will bring you closer to the goal and build towards it little by little.
